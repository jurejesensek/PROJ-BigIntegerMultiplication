	FFT algorithm is number multiplication algorithm which uses Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). FFT is a way to compute the Fourier transform of a sequence A with length <code>n</code> in time \(O(n log(n)) \) instead of \(O(n^2) \) with the classical way.
	Before the transformation, both large integers have to be present as polynomials <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> with selected base (base of numbers in java bytearrays is 256). For transformation to succeed, the sequence of coefficients in polynomial must be of length \( (2^n) \). As a result, we get two sequences <code>A*</code> and <code>B*</code> of complex numbers where we multiply like terms into sequence <code>Z*</code>. To get back integers, we must compute the inverse Fourier transform <code>Z</code> of <code>Z*</code> (with the conjugate FFT process).
	The result is product of both large numbers, converted to sequence of integers (polynomial) with our selected base.
