    FFT algorithm is number multiplication algorithm which uses Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). FFT is a way to compute the Fourier transform of a sequence A with length n in time \( \O(n logn) \) instead of \( \O(n^2) \) with the classical way.
    Before the transformation, both large integers have to be present as polynomials A and B with selected base (base of numbers in java bytearrays is 256). For transformation to succeed, the sequence of coefficients in polynomial must be of length 2^n. As a result, we get two sequences A* and B* of complex numbers where we multiply like terms into sequence Z*. To get back integers, we must compute the inverse Fourier transform Z of Z* (with the conjugate FFT process).
    The result is product of both large numbers, converted to sequence of integers (polynomial) with our selected base.
