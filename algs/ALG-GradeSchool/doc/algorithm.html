    Grade-School (or Long multiplication or Standard Algorithm) is number multiplication algorithm that multiplies the multiplicand by each digit of the multiplier and then add up all the properly shifted results. It requires memorization of the multiplication table for single digits. 
    Its name comes from the fact that this is the usual algorithm for multiplying larger numbers by hand in base 10, often taught in schools. Computers initially used a very similar shift and add algorithm in base 2, but modern processors have optimized circuitry for fast multiplications using more efficient algorithms, at the price of a more complex hardware realization. A person doing long multiplication on paper will write down all the products and then add them together, taking care of the carry when the sum is bigger than the base. With the place for carry included, product of <code>k-digit</code> and <code>l-digit</code> number is <code>(k+l)-digit</code> number and multiplication table has dimensions of <code>l x (k+l)</code>.
