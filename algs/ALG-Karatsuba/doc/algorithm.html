        The Karatsuba algorithm if a divide-and-conquer algorithms for fast multiplication of numbers.
        It was discovered by Anatoly Karatsuba in 1960, and was the first multiplication algorithm that was asymptotically faster than the "grade school" method.

        <b>Time complexity: </b> algorithm performs multiplication in \( O(n^{log_2 3}) \approx O(n^{1,585}) \).
